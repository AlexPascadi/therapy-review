Relevant paragraphs from the project's specification
(https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter21/cs97-1/project.html):

Since you will submit your repository, it should also contain a README file (plaintext or 
Markdown) describing in detail how someone who cloned it can run your app. This should, of course,
include any shell commands needed for setup.

One team member must submit a compressed tarball of your GitHub repository to CCLE. This should 
contain all your groupâ€™s work, including any documentation, presentations, etc. The repository 
should not include generated files, only source code; the README file should explain how to 
generate any files (e.g., node modules) buildable from the source (adding their names to your 
.gitignore file can help you avoid submitting them by mistake). You should be able to obtain 
such a tarball directly from GitHub. 
Name the file UID-project.tar.gz, where UID is your student ID.
